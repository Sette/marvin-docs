Working in an Existent Engine
================================

In this chapter we have some examples of how work with an existing engine.

1. If you don’t have an engine locally, clone one to your local machine

2. On Python Toolbox environment, set VirtualEnv and get to engine’s path::

    $ marvin engine-generateenv /path/to/engine/
    $ workon <engine_name>-env


3. Test your engine::

    $ marvin


4. Bring up the notebook and access it from your browser::

    $ marvin notebook
