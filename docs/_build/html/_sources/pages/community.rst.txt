This section explains how to contribute with Apache Marvin-AI Platform. 

GitHub
--------------


GitHub is a project and code version management system as well as a social networking platform designed for developers. In harmony, Apache Marvin-AI is an effort undergoing Incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator. 

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

Thus, Apache Marvin-AI is a project available on GitHub as open source for collaborative development and can be accessed here_.
